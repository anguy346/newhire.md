# New Staff Hire

## **Recruitment Process**
- *An open recruitment which will take 30 days at minimum* 
    - However, if there is urgency to this because of their involvement with the project and an upcoming conference, you may consider bringing them on as an unpaid volunteer to keep them involved during recruitment setup. 


### Step 1: Access the Recruitment Portal 

1. Use the link [iRecruit]( https://irecruitportal.ucr.edu/irecruit/!Controller) and initate a new recruitment using the top link. 
2. Once you select the title you want, the system gives you a job description template to work from which you modify.

### Step 2: Title and Pay Plan 

1. Use this [link](http://tpp.ucr.edu/tpp/tpp_main.mainpage) to chose an appropriate title and pay plan
    - HR will confirm whether it is an  appropriate title based on how you populate the job description. 
    -  In addition, you will also enter your hiring committee and other details within this system.

### Step 3: Job Description 

1. (Within the title/pay plan [website](http://tpp.ucr.edu/tpp/tpp_main.mainpage)) Under job description tab select the fourth link down "Initiate a Career Tracks Job Description"
    - That will take you through the process to generate the template which you may modify.
